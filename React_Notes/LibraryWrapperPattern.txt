Don't import the whole libraries in react as they take too much space
// before:
import _ from 'lodash' -> imported 71.78KB
// after:
import debounce from "lodash/debounce"; -> imported 3.41KB
import merge from 'lodash/merge'; -> imported 16KB

now it will be very tideous to manage this for different file in PR as well also.
so for this use wrapper pattern like this
import debounce from "lodash/debounce"; -> 3.41KB
const lodashWrapper = {
  debounce
};
export default lodashWrapper;

Now we also have to consider which library to import as some may not support direct imports for individual components.
