    Hello world
    <script>

        // at first html is requested then css is requested then the browser does something known as DOM
        // DOM is something a browser creates to allow us to modify the html and css
        // now javasript engine is the one which reads the javascript line by line
        // chrome has V8 engine
        // Edge has chalker core
        // safari has nitro
        // firefox has spidermonkey
        // now the document is the screen we see in broswer and that document is just an object
        // window is the parent of everything in the browser and describes the browser anytime we use a method
        // a web browser has a window object that has a property document that specifies what should get displayed 
        // and to decide what get displayed the document object model reads the HTML and CSS
        // and then javascript is read line by line something like a javascript engine
        // and if needs to change anything javascript can speak with the DOM and modify the HTML and CSS
        // console.log(document)  this is document object model
        // maybe document didn't look like object but it is, but browser shows us it in this way so that we can play with with it

        // window.console.log(window)
        // console.log(document.body)
        // document.body.style.background = "yellow"
