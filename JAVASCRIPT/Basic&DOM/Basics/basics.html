    The keyword const is a little misleading.
    It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.
    let x = "5" + 2 + 3;
    If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
    let x = 2 + 3 + "5"
    this will give 55

    for const
    you can not
    Reassign a constant value
    Reassign a constant array
    Reassign a constant object
    But you CAN:
    Change and add the elements of constant array
    Change and add the properties of constant object

    types of javascript operators 
    Arithmetic Operators
    Assignment Operators
    Comparison Operators
    String Operators
    Logical Operators
    Bitwise Operators
    Ternary Operators
    Type Operators

    adding a number and a string will return a string:
    let z = "Hello" + 5;
    Hello5
    When used on strings, the + operator is called the concatenation operator.

    When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction or multiplication and division), they are computed from left to right:

    JavaScript has 8 Datatypes
    1. String
    2. Number
    3. Bigint
    4. Boolean
    5. Undefined
    6. Null
    7. Symbol
    8. Object

    Bigint is used when we go above Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
    Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER = 9007199254740991
    and want to do some calculation
    but for the calculations to work we put n after the operands
    9007199254740991n + 10n
    
    The object data type can contain:
    1. An object
    2. An array
    3. A date
    const date = new Date("2022-03-25");

    let x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo";
    20Volvo
    let x = "Volvo" + 16 + 4;
    Volvo164
    const square = (x) => x**2
    means x ki power 2

    if var a is already defined then by writing a in console it give its value but if var a is written only then it gives undefined
    can use both single and double Quotes for string but thing to notice is output of 
    'this isn\'t very nice'  here backslash means ignore anything after it
    10+"34"
    '1034'
    "34"+10
    '3410'
    10-"3"
    7
    "3"-10
    -7
    "hello"-"bye"
    NaN
    10 + + "3"
    13
    typeof(+"3")
    'number'
    typeof(-"bye")
    'number'
    3 = 3 ain't true cause it means assign value 3 to variable 3 but a variable can't start with a number
    a variable can only start with alphabet of $ or _

    Javascript numbers are always one type:
    double (64-bit floating point).
    Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.
    <button onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>
